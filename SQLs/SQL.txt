TRUNCATE TABLE applicant;  --> clear table command

show indexes from tableName

alter table applicant add column age int --> add column
alter table applicant add column age int after username --> column age will be after username column

select * from tableName --> show all rows and columns

select column1,column2 from tableName --> select column1 and column2

select * from applicant where firstname = "ali" --> give the datas that their firstnames are "ali";

select * from applicant where age >= 18 --> give the datas that their ages are >= 18;

select * from applicant where firstname is null --> give the datas that their fisrtnames don't have values

select * from applicant where firstname is not null -->

//you can use the column names instead of (*) like line 2 of this txt

update tableName set columnName = some value where ...
update applicant set firstname = "hossein" where username = 4011  --> change data which its firstname = "hossein" , you can use other variables instead of username
update applicant set firstname = "hossein" where username = 4011 and lasrname = "ajezi" --> and   
update applicant set firstname = "hossein" where username = 4011 or lasrname = "ajezi" --> or
update applicant set firstname = "hossein" where not username = 4011 --> not
update applicant set firstname = "hossein" where age berween 18 and 30 --> between 
it can develop like : update firstname = "hossein",age = null,password = "55811",... where ...
